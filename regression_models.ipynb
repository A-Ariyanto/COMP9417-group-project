        "\n",
        "1.  **Significant Improvement Over Baseline**: All implemented machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and SVM) consistently achieved significantly lower RMSE values compared to the Baseline (Naïve) model across all pollutants and prediction horizons. This indicates that even simple machine learning approaches are much more effective than a naive forecast for this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Top Performing Models**: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (MLP) models generally showed the best performance, often yielding the lowest RMSE values for most pollutants and horizons.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Intermediate Performers**: Random Forest and XGBoost models performed well, consistently outperforming the Baseline and Decision Tree, but were often slightly behind Linear Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks in terms of RMSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Decision Tree Performance**: The Decision Tree Regressor consistently had higher RMSE values compared to other machine learning models, suggesting it was the least effective among the advanced models for this forecasting task.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Consistency Across Horizons**: The relative performance rankings of the models remained fairly consistent across different prediction horizons (1, 6, 12, and 24 hours). There wasn't a single model that drastically improved or worsened its relative standing at longer horizons.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the advanced models provide robust improvements over simple baseline methods, with Linear Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks showing the strongest predictive power for this time series forecasting problem."
