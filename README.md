# Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning system to forecast urban air pollution levels one hour into the future \(t + 1\) using sensor data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The system predicts concentrations of **Carbon Monoxide (\(CO\))**, **Nitrogen Oxides (\(NO_x, NO_2\))**, and **Benzene (\(C_6H_6\))**.  
The primary objective is to compare the predictive performance of traditional statistical baselines (**Linear Regression**) against modern ensemble learning techniques (**Random Forest** and **XGBoost**) to determine the most effective approach for short-term environmental forecasting.
